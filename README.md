This research draws from the insights presented in two key articles: *"Indian Legal Documents Corpus for
Court Judgment Prediction and Explanation"*  and *"Leveraging Entity-Aware and Hierarchical Transformers For Legal Entity Recognition and Court Judgment Prediction"* . The primary objective is to optimize
the preprocessing techniques, refine the dataset, and employ advanced models to achieve superior Named
Entity Recognition (NER) results specifically tailored for legal data.
NER remains a well-explored challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP), supported by various
publicly available pre-trained models. However, legal documents pose unique complexities due to their
distinctive named entities such as petitioner names, respondent details, court references, statutes, provisions,
precedents, and more. These specialized entity types are not effectively identified by conventional Named
Entity Recognizers like spaCy. Therefore, there is a critical necessity to develop NER models that are finely
attuned to the nuances of legal terminology and structures, especially as it holds significant importance serving
as a foundational step for various crucial tasks in the legal domain, including automated summarization,
legal recommendation systems, and comprehensive case law analysis. The accuracy and reliability of NER
models specifically designed for court judgment texts are pivotal in ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness
of downstream applications in the legal realm.
In this research endeavor, our primary objective is threefold. Initially, we aim to replicate the findings
and performance metrics of the NER model proposed in the article "Leveraging Entity-Aware and Hierarchical Transformers For Legal Entity Recognition and Court Judgment Prediction" [4]. This step will serve
as a benchmark for our subsequent improvements and modifications. Subsequently, we will introduce enhancements to the existing model, focusing on refining methodologies, exploring alternative techniques, or
leveraging novel approaches to achieve superior NER outcomes for legal entity recognition. Our aim is to
investigate and showcase the potential for enhancing the modelâ€™s performance in accurately identifying and
classifying legal entities within judgment texts. Finally, our research culminates in a comprehensive evaluation
and analysis of the developed models. We will critically assess their strengths and weaknesses, highlighting
the nuanced intricacies of NER models tailored specifically for legal recognition. Moreover, our conclusions
will provide invaluable insights into the efficacy of these models, offering guidance and recommendations for
future advancements in this domain.
